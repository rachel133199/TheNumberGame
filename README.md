# TheNumberGame
#### Number Game was a game in a British TV Show called Countdown. The gamemaster will give the players 5 numbers and a target number, and they have to come up with a solution using these 5 numbers(each number can only be used once) to get the target number. +,-,*,/ are the four operations allowed in the game. This was definitely one of the more challenging but also fun problems on my CS assignments. First, I need to use Heap's algorithm to generate all permutations given five numbers. Then I need to generate all possible tuples of the four operators. Then, using the Catalan number as a checker, I need to find out all possible BET(binary expression tress) given a list of numbers and a list of operators. After checking each of these BETs, my program finally came up with a solution!
